## pedal-sniper
Pedal Sniper checks a guitar store's website for updates to their used effects pedal listings and opens the page if there's anything new added.

It's pretty straightforward as a template for monitoring any site for changes. Just change the `url` and `searchQuery` variables. Run it from the terminal with something like `watch -n 60 ./pedal-sniper.sh`.
